### üéØ Purpose & Scope

**Game Over** is designed as an interactive catalog of free-to-play games. Users can:

* Create an account and securely log in
* Browse games by category (e.g., Shooter, RPG, Strategy)
* View detailed information and screenshots for each game
* Toggle between light and dark themes, with preferences saved across sessions

This purely client-side app uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, leveraging external APIs for authentication and game data.

### üèó System Architecture

Client-side MVC pattern with four main components:

1. **User Interface**

   * `index.html` (Login)
   * `register.html` (Sign-up)
   * `home.html` (Browse & filter)
   * `details.html` (Game details)

2. **Authentication System**

   * `auth.js` handles registration, login, and token storage (in `localStorage`)
   * Uses the Movies API for sign-in/sign-up endpoints

3. **Game Data System**

   * `home.js`: Fetches and renders game lists by category (`/api/games?category=`)
   * `details.js`: Fetches and renders game details by ID (`/api/game?id=`)

4. **Theme System**

   * Toggles `data-theme` attribute on `<html>`
   * Stores preference under `localStorage['mode']`

```mermaid
graph LR
  subgraph UI
    A[index.html] -->|login| B[home.html]
    B --> C[details.html]
    A --> D[register.html]
  end
  subgraph Auth
    A --POST /signin--> E(Movies API)
    D --POST /signup--> E
    E --token--> auth.js -->|store| localStorage
  end
  subgraph Data
    B --GET /api/games--> home.js -->|render| B
    C --GET /api/game?id|--> details.js -->|render| C
  end
  subgraph Theme
    UI -->|toggle| theme.js -->|save| localStorage
  end
```
